About me:

Umeko Walker is a web and android developer. She started coding by teaching herself Java and android development. During the first year of debugging, she found two new passions: learning and problem solving. A career in software development allows Umeko to build and utilize these skills to create wonderful software. Umeko is now a student at Lambda School. Java and JavaScript are her favorite languages even though she considers herself a jack-of-all-trades. Her goal is to get a job in the field and to continue to work on personal projects. No matter how much Umeko grows she will always have a beginners mind. Umeko's favorite project is the Empathy Builder. A calculator that helps people to understand how challenging it is for victims of domestic violence to relocate. You can check it out, here.
